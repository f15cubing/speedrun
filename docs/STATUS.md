## Done

- **Decisions** signed off (PRD §16: D1 Rust=mastery query, D2 three-score + give-up, D3 Android via
  rsdroid, D4 taxonomy, D5 ablation pre-registered).
- **Repo + licensing:** public AGPL-3.0 fork, `LICENSE` + Anki credit; submodules pinned
  (`anki@25.09.4`, `Anki-Android@v2.24.0`).
- **Spike 1 — desktop build:** `./run` compiled + ran a full review loop (exit 0).
- **Spike 2 — Android build:** `assembleFullDebug` SUCCESSFUL with `librsdroid.so`; emulator booted,
  AnkiDroid launched.
- **PR #1** (merged) — seeded GRE study-deck generator + `topic::*` tagging + coverage gate
  (`pipeline/`).
- **PR #2** (merged) — MIT OCW gold-set store + canary + validator, data gitignored (`eval/goldset/`).
- **PR #3** (merged) — workflow change-risk tiers + fast lane, compile-cache + trust-green, live
  `STATUS.md`, process-freeze guardrail (`.cursor/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`).
- **PR #4** (merged) — content-generation + timed-UI design spec, tuesday-data-foundation spec, and
  the content-generation pipeline plan, with matching PRD/INDEX/architecture/execution-plan updates
  (§8 interleaving algorithm, §8a flashcards→MCQ→timed, §12a two-lane generation, Appendix A
  tag/verification conventions).

## In flight

- **Wednesday Mastery Query spec** — drafting the read-only Mastery Query (Rust engine change,
  PRD §5) design spec via `brainstorming`, as the first decomposed Wednesday sub-spec.

## Next (per execution-plan)

- **Wednesday — Milestone 1:** Rust mastery-query change end-to-end (read RPC, never `OpChanges`) →
  desktop review + memory score as a range + coverage map; Android reviews the shared deck on the
  same engine; sync-server smoke test. **This is the critical path — front-load it.**
